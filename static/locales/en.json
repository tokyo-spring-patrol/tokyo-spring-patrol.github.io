    "des": "Tokyo Spring Homeless Patrol is a volunteer group supporting the homeless community in Tokyo. We operate weekly patrols in Shinjuku on Sundays (19:45–21:20) and Ueno on Wednesdays (19:45–20:45). On average, we serve around 100 people in Shinjuku and 50 in Ueno each week. Each individual receives a simple meal consisting of a sandwich, onigiri, or bento, a can of fish, and a banana. Volunteers play a key role by bringing the food items we distribute. Contributions typically include items such as 40–50 bananas, 20–30 cans of fish, or 20–25 onigiri or sandwiches. The specific items and quantities are coordinated with the patrol leader before the patrol date. We welcome new volunteers and appreciate any support that helps us continue this community effort.",
